ABSTRACT

The generation of sequencing reads in real-time, which, in combination with fast library preparation, immensely reduces the time needed to go from biological sample to data analysis, enables (for example) intraoperative decision-making8, improved global food security by rapid identification of plant viruses9 and portable genomic surveillance

The relative even base and strand coverage facilitates accurate SNP and mutation retrieval and discovery. [Michal Mokry, 2010]

Removing the need for short reads, and higher coverage via improvements in non-hybrid error correction tools and/or long-read sequencing accuracy, would reduce the cost, length, and complexity of genomic projects. [Amar 2020]

dynamically updated decision strategies

decide whether the expected decrease in uncertainty that it would provide warrants fully sequencing it, thus optimizing information gain

We quantify uncertainty at each genome position with real-time updates from data already observed.

Our method can focus sequencing on variant sites, without a priori knowledge of their location, increasing the accuracy of called genotypes.

prior of this distribution can be informed by reference genomes (in the sense of any assembly) and is subsequently updated as we collect data throughout the experimentâ€”that is, we calculate a posterior probability distribution based on the observed nucleotides at that position.


mitigates coverage bias between and within members of a microbial community, leading to improved variant calling

We address this issue by generating dynamic decision strategies that redistribute coverage to positions of greatest value at any time during an experiment. 


REVIEW

CHALLENGES:

Most of these false rejections (84%) were due to inability to determine the source species from the initial fragment.

with longer reads giving larger enrichment over the range of read lengths studied



To maximize selective sequencing, identification must be accomplished before the read completes. This depends on two parameters. Firstly, speed of sequence identification and placement on the reference and secondly, average read length of the library. 


Challenges include read counting and overcoming sources of latency within the system
